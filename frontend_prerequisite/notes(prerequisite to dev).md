# What is INTERNET?
ans:
The Internet is a global wide area network that connects computer systems across the world. 
With the Internet, it's possible to access almost any information, communicate with anyone else in the world.
nternet is a global network of physical cables, which can include copper telephone wires, TV cables, and fiber optic cables. Even wireless connections like Wi-Fi and 3G/4G rely on these physical cables to access the Internet.
The World Wide Web is one of its biggest services

# How the internet works?
ans:
When we search on our web browser the search request goes directly to our Internet Service Provider (ISP). ISP sends these requests to the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS is a library that has all websites IP addresses. DNS gives the IP address of that site to ISP. ISP gives the IP address to the web browser and then the request is gone to the Google server. Then the google server gives us the HTML, CSS, javaScript file.

# What is HTTP and how it evolved?
ans:
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol which is basically responsible for communication between web servers and clients. It is defined as the protocol of the web, or we can say it is the set of rules used in the delivery of web pages from servers to the client.
evolution of HTTP:
HTTP 0.9: The One-Line Protocol
HTTP/1.0: Rapid Growth and Informational RFC
HTTP/1.1: Internet Standard
HTTP/2: Improving Transport Performance

# HTTP/3: the past, the present, and the future
HTTP/3 is the next protocol for network communication across the Web, which is meant to partially replace HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.
HTTP/3 promises to make Internet connections faster, more reliable, and more secure.
QUIC is a key element of HTTP/3, since it provides the foundations for its main features

# How Browsers Work: Behind the scenes of modern web browsers
ans:
1. User Interface:
It is a space where interaction between user and browser (application) occurs via the control presented in the browser.
2. Browser Engine:
It provides a high-level interface between UI and the underlying rendering engine.
3. Rendering Engine:
The Rendering Engine is responsible for displaying the content of the web page on the screen.
4. Networking:
Component of the browser which retrieves the URLs using the common internet protocols of HTTP or FTP
5. JavaScript Interpreter: 
It is the component of the browser which interprets and executes the javascript code embedded in a website. 
6. UI Backend: 
UI backend is used for drawing basic widgets like combo boxes and windows.
7. Data Persistence/Storage: 
This is a persistence layer. Browsers support storage mechanisms such as localStorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL and FileSystem
# How DNS works?
ans:
The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like google.com Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1
